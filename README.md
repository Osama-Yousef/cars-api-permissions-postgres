# Lab: 32 - Permissions & Postgresql

## Overview
- Let’s move our site closer to production grade by adding Permissions and Postgresql Database.


## Feature Tasks and Requirements
### Features - General
- You have been supplied with two demos, each presenting a key new feature.
  * blogapi-permissions demonstrates how to restrict access to portions of your APIs data.
  * blogapi-postgres demonstrates switching over to using postgres vs sqlite
- Your job is to merge the functionality of both demos.
- Customize your project to use different application features/models than Blog and Post
### Features - Django REST Framework
- Make your site a DRF powered API as you did in previous lab.
- Adjust project’s permissions so that only authenticated user’s have access to API.
- Add a custom permission so that only author of blog post can update or delete it.
- Add ability to switch user’s directly from browsable API.
### Features - Docker
- NOTE Refer to demo for built out Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml examples.
- create Dockerfile based off python:3.8-slim
- create docker-compose.yml to run Django app as a web service.
- enter docker-compose up --build to start your site.
- add postgres 11 as a service
  * Note: It is not required to include a volume so that data can persist when container is shut down.
- Go to browsable api and confirm site properly restricts users based on their permissions.

## Implementation Notes
- You should NOT be running Postgres directly on host machine.
- This means that operations like createsuperuser and migrate will need to happen inside the container.
